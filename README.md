          for my reference 
1. Working on Booth's Multipler (concept)and try to find out way to reduce the length of 8-bit and 16b bit design code.
2. insted of 16 1 mux and 1 16 demux using function and tsk..i did 8 1 and 1 8
3. still mixing type of modelling(dataflow,behavirol,structural) while writing design code
4. comparator is pending (concept is clear)
5. gate using mux pending (concept is clear)
